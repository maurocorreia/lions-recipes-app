Lions Recipes is a recipe app where you can check how to do your favorite meals and drinks. You can browse by categories, ingredients, and even nationality. This application was made by a team of four and built to serve as my finishing project for my front-end course at Trybe. Our app has features like favoriting and sharing the recipe, a profile section with done, and favorite recipes.
